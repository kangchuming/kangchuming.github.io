Welcome to my personal blog, where I document and reflect on the challenges, solutions, and insights Iâ€™ve encountered as a full-stack engineer. From debugging tricky code to architecting scalable systems, this space is my digital notebook for sharing lessons learned, technical deep dives, and the occasional rant about the joys (and frustrations) of building modern web applications. Join me on this journey!
